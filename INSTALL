Basic Installation
==================
1. mkdir build && cd build
2. ccmake .. (and the rest of the configuration stuff)
3. make (inside the same folder)
4. make install
- will probably go fubar, so iterate on step 2 and 3 until it works
- check out your environment variables with "env"

The output is a shared library called mccore.
